# Feature Specification: Roblox Trading Platform with Escrow

**Feature Branch**: `001-develop-a-platform`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Develop a platform where users authenticate via Roblox OAuth, then either publish a trade (by entering a Brainrot name and uploading an image) or search trades by text (Brainrot name) and contact the creator. Users can chat to negotiate, and once both agree, each must complete payment within a shared deadline. When both payments succeed, escrow captures the funds and the system notifies available human middlemen. A middleman then joins the trade room as quickly as possible to supervise the in-game exchange. If only one user pays before expiry, the payer is refunded and the trade is canceled. After the middleman validates the exchange, the trade is finalized and closed. For any other issue, users are instructed to contact support by joining the discord community and creating a ticket"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

A Roblox user wants to trade their rare "Brainrot" items with other players safely. They authenticate with their Roblox account, create a trade listing with the item name and image, then wait for interested traders. When someone contacts them, they negotiate through chat, agree on terms, and both make payments within a deadline. The platform holds the funds in escrow while a human middleman supervises the actual in-game trade to ensure both parties receive their items before releasing the payments.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user is authenticated with Roblox OAuth, **When** they create a trade listing with item name and image, **Then** the listing appears in search results for other users
2. **Given** two users have agreed on a trade, **When** both complete payment within the deadline, **Then** escrow captures funds and notifies available middlemen
3. **Given** a middleman is supervising a trade, **When** they validate the in-game exchange is complete, **Then** the trade is finalized and funds are released
4. **Given** only one user pays before the deadline, **When** the deadline expires, **Then** the paying user is automatically refunded and the trade is canceled
5. **Given** users need support, **When** they encounter issues, **Then** they are directed to join Discord and create a support ticket

### Edge Cases

- When no middlemen are available after payment, users must contact support via Discord ticket
- How does system handle network failures during payment processing?
- What if a middleman goes offline during trade supervision?
- How are disputes resolved if middleman cannot determine trade completion?
- What happens if Roblox OAuth becomes unavailable?

## Clarifications

- Q: What payment method should the platform support for trade transactions? → A: Stripe (credit/debit cards using redirection to stripe)
- Q: How should middlemen be authenticated and verified for trust? → A: User generated id + password for middleman
- Q: What constitutes valid proof for middlemen to validate an in-game exchange is complete? → A: Internal (not platform handled)
- Q: How long should users have to complete their payments after agreeing to trade terms? → A: 30 minutes
- Q: What should happen when no middlemen are available after both users have paid? → A: Contact support via Discord ticket
