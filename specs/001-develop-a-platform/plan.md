# Implementation Plan: Roblox Trading Platform with Escrow

**Branch**: `001-develop-a-platform` | **Date**: 2025-09-25 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-develop-a-platform/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Develop a web platform for secure Roblox item trading with escrow services. Users authenticate via Roblox OAuth, create/search trade listings, negotiate via real-time chat, make Stripe payments within 30-minute deadlines, and rely on human middlemen to supervise in-game exchanges before fund release. Technical approach uses Next.js 15 with App Router, React 19, Prisma/PostgreSQL, Socket.io for real-time features, Better Auth for authentication, and Cloudflare R2 for image uploads.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, Node.js 18+
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, Prisma (PostgreSQL), Socket.io, Better Auth, Stripe, Cloudflare R2
**Storage**: PostgreSQL database, Cloudflare R2 for image uploads
**Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests, Jest for integration tests
**Target Platform**: Web application (Chrome/Firefox/Safari), responsive mobile support
**Project Type**: web (Next.js full-stack application)
**Performance Goals**: <3s page loads, <200ms API responses, real-time chat <100ms latency
**Constraints**: 30-minute payment deadlines, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, secure payment processing
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-user trading platform, real-time features, payment integration, file uploads

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single Next.js project with App Router) - Full-stack web application

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Database setup: Prisma schema, migrations, seeders [P]
- Authentication: Better Auth + Roblox OAuth integration [P]
- API contracts: REST endpoints from OpenAPI spec [P]
- WebSocket: Socket.io server and event handling [P]
- Payment integration: Stripe payment intents and webhooks [P]
- File uploads: Cloudflare R2 integration [P]
- UI components: shadcn/ui components for all pages [P]
- Real-time features: Chat, notifications, status updates
- Middleman interface: Authentication and trade supervision
- Each entity → Prisma model + validation [P]
- Each API endpoint → contract test + integration test [P]
- Each user story → E2E test scenario

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Infrastructure first: Database, auth, file storage
- API layer: REST endpoints and WebSocket events
- UI layer: Components, pages, real-time updates
- Integration: Payment processing, middleman workflow
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Technology-Specific Tasks**:
- Next.js App Router setup and configuration
- Prisma schema definition and database migrations
- Better Auth configuration with Roblox provider
- Socket.io server integration with Next.js
- Stripe webhook handling and escrow management
- Cloudflare R2 signed URL generation
- shadcn/ui component installation and customization
- TypeScript strict mode configuration
- Biome linting and formatting setup

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
